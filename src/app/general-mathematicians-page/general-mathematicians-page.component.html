        <h3>The Mathematicians</h3>
            <h5>Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci)</h5>
                <p>Fun fact, Leonardo Pisano nicknamed himself Fibonacci since Bonacci was the family name (.. .. .. .. ..??????) and the "Fi" part was short for "Filius" meaning son (.. .. .. ..??????). This would be similar to people today who have a last name like Johnson or Jackson. Of course, his most famous mathematical discovery was the Fibonnaci Sequence/Fibonacci Numbers. .. .. .. .. ..</p>
            <h5>Pythagoras</h5>
                <p>Pythagoras is most well known for the Pythagorean Theorem that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (the sum of the squares of a triangles legs is equal to the square of its hypotenuse); however, there is actually no evidence that he proved the theorem. However, there is much more fun trivia to know about him. He is sometimes called the first "true" mathematician (but some would attribute the title to Thales of Miletus), and he was born in 570 BC and died in 490 BC. He also founded a sort of cult called the mathematikoi, and one of they were obsessed with whole numbers and their ratios. The door of his school was inscripted with "all is number." When the Pythagoreans used the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse of a triangle with leg lenghts of 1, they got (.. .. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..) root 2 as their answer. Next of course, they had to figure out what ratio would equal root 2 (.. .. .. ..). Then, after more and more frantic attempts, a guy named Hippasus of Metapontum proved that root 2 was an irrational number, meaning it <i>couldn't</i>  be any sort of ratio. Then, as legend has it, Pythagoras and his other followers murdered poor Hippasus for this. The Pythagoreans never really bounced back after this recovery as it completely disproved one of their most deeply held beliefs. His death is also a fun legend to tell. For one, we don't know much about it or even his life since his followers were instructed to not write any of his teachings down and they were sworn to secrecy. This makes it very hard to tell the truth of his life from the lies about it. There are as many as 10 different versions of the story of his death. Anyways, here is the legend surrounding his death. But to understand this, you must first understand that those who strayed from any of the ideas of the Pythagorean Brotherhood were thrown out with great ceremony. (They would even have a mock funeral for the old member whom the members would then pretend no longer existed.) One of the rules you weren't allowed to break was that you couldn't eat beans. Pythagoras <i><b>HATED</b></i> those evil beans. .. .. .. .. .. .. ..</p>
