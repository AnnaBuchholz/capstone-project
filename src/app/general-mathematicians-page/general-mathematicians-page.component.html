        <h3>The Mathematicians</h3>
            <h5>Leonardo Pisano (Fibonacci)</h5>
                    <blockquote>Fibonacci himself never actually wrote "Fibonacci."</blockquote>
                <p>Fun fact, Leonardo Pisano got the nickname Fibonacci because it was short for "Filius Bonacci", meaning "the son of Bonaccio," (his father's name was Guglielmo Bonaccio and the plural of "Bonaccio" would be "Bonacci"). This would be similar to people today who have a last name like Johnson or Jackson. However, Fibonacci himself never actually wrote "Fibonacci," though he did write variations such as "Bonacci," "Bonaccii," and "Bonaccij." The modern spelling of "Fibonacci" is sometimes attributed to Guillaume Libri from 1838 (<a href="http://www.maths.surrey.ac.uk/hosted-sites/R.Knott/Fibonacci/fibBio.html">Source</a>). Now, onto Fibonacci's mathematical accomplishments. Of course, his most famous mathematical discovery was the Fibonacci Sequence/Fibonacci Numbers (which start at 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... with the rule being that the last two numbers in the sequence are added together make the next number), but the truth is that he was not actually the first person to think of that series. Nevertheless, he did have other notable mathematical accomplishments. Less commonly known is the fact that there are other series that have been modeled after the Fibonacci Series, such as the Lucas Series (which starts at 2, 1 instead of 0, 1). A more notable accomplishment of Fibonacci's was that he introduced Arabic numerals (0-9) to the European world (instead of Roman numerals which lacked a 0 and place value). Additionally, Fibonacci introduced the fraction bar used today (instead of quotation marks) and the modern notation for square roots.

            <h5>Pythagoras</h5>
                <p>Pythagoras is most well known for the Pythagorean Theorem that a^2 + b^2 = c^2 (the sum of the squares of a triangles legs is equal to the square of its hypotenuse); however, there is actually no evidence that he proved the theorem, though there is still much more fun trivia to know about him.</p>
                    <blockquote>Pythagoras also founded a sort of cult called the Mathematikoi.</blockquote>
                <p>For example, most people don't know that he was a slave in Egypt for six years. He is sometimes called the first "true" mathematician (but some would attribute the title to Thales of Miletus), and he was born in 570 BC and died in 490 BC. He also founded a sort of cult called the mathematikoi, and they were obsessed with whole numbers and their ratios. The door of his school was inscripted with "all is number." When the Pythagoreans used the Pythagorean Theorem to find the hypotenuse of a triangle with leg lenghts of 1, they got root 2 as their answer. Next of course, they had to figure out what ratio would equal root 2. Eventually, after increasingly frantic attempts, a guy named Hippasus of Metapontum proved that root 2 was an irrational number, meaning it <i>couldn't</i>  be any sort of ratio. Then, as legend has it, Pythagoras and his other followers murdered poor Hippasus for this. The Pythagoreans never really bounced back after this recovery as it completely disproved one of their most deeply held beliefs. His death is also a fun legend to tell. For one, we don't know much about it or even his life since his followers were instructed to not write any of his teachings down and they were sworn to secrecy. This makes it very hard to tell the truth of his life from the lies about it. There are as many as 10 different versions of the story of his death. Anyways, here is the legend surrounding his death. But to understand this, you must first understand that those who strayed from any of the ideas of the Pythagorean Brotherhood were thrown out with great ceremony. (They would even have a mock funeral for the old member whom the members would then pretend no longer existed.) One of the rules you weren't allowed to break was that you couldn't eat beans. Pythagoras believed in reincarnation and that these beans could have been humans in another life, so he refused to let anyone eat or otherwise malign them. (According to legend, he once saw an ox eating beans, ran over and told it to never eat beans again, and it never did throughout its very long life according to the farmers who were near there.) Anyways, this guy named Kylon was the son of a wealthy nobleman and even though he wasn't particularly smart, he told Pythagoras he wanted to join the Pythagorean Brotherhood. Even though every other member had gone through years of training, silence, and deep contemplation, he expected to be let in without doing any of that. Pythagoras bluntly told him no, so Kylon got mad and decided to take revenge on Pythagoras and his Brotherhood. Kylon gathered the locals and riled them up so that they went and burned down the Brotherhood where many of the members died right away. Of the ones who escaped the fires, many of them got stabbed by the townspeople. Pythagoras was able to get out with some of his loyal followers' help, and he fled to the countryside. Eventually, he reached a bean field that reached as far as eye can see, and since he didn't ever want to step on any beans, he stopped to think. Seeing a bean right in front of his feet, he decided to stay true to his beliefs and not risk trampling any beans, even if it cost him his life. And it did.

            <h5>Euclid</h5>
                <p>So, you want to know about Euclid? Well, so does the rest of the world. Similarly to Homer, we don't even know if Euclid was one person or a whole group of people (but for clarity I will refer to Euclid as "he" from here on out).</p>
                    <blockquote>How could two parallel lines ever cross at <i>any</i> point, no matter how for left, right, up, or down one looks?</blockquote>
                <p>We do know that he did a lot of work on geometry, which is why geometry on a plane is often called Euclidean Geometry. Euclid started with just five axioms (which is essentially just what assumptions he started out with) in <i>Elements</i>. 1. "A straight line may be drawn between any two points." 2. "Any terminated straight line may be extended indefinitely." 3. "A circle may be drawn with any given point as center and any given radius." 4. "All right angles are equal." 5. "If two straight lines in a plane are met by another line, and if the sum of the internal angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the straight lines will meet if extended sufficiently on the side on which the sum of the angles is less than two right angles."" (Or, a shorter version for #5 would be "For any given point not on a given line, there is exactly one line through the point that does not meet the given line.") (<a href="http://www.math.brown.edu/~banchoff/Beyond3d/chapter9/section01.html">Source</a>) You've likely noticed that Axiom #5 is noticeably longer than the other four. This is because the first four are relatively intuitive, and Euclid had tried and tried and tried to use those four to prove the fifth, but he was unable to do so no matter how hard he tried. This irritated him to no end, so he eventually simply tacked on the "Parallel Line Axiom" (#5) to the end. He was able to then use this postulate to prove many of his famous theorems, including the one that says all triangles are 180 degrees exactly. Even after Euclid tacked on that fifth axiom, mathematicians continued to try to use the first four to prove the last one. They kept at it until around the 19th century when the 5th axiom was finally proven to... not arise from the first four? But how could that be? How could two parallel lines ever cross at <i>any</i> point, no matter how for left, right, up, or down one looks? Well, Euclidean Geometry certainly works on a <i>flat</i> surface, but it won't work on a sphere (or on a hyperbolic surface). (And for reference, <i>calculus</i> was created in the 17th century!) Think about it - if there is a sphere with a line across its equator, and one that crosses it to make four 90 degree angles, then when one moves the sphere such that the equator is in the same spot, but the other line essentially surrounds the circle, then the two lines would be intersected at 90 degrees if a line were to connect them, seemingly making them two parallel lines. But as we already saw, the lines meet each other at two other points on the sphere. Spherical geometry has other similarly counter-intuitive properties (like how lines, even "parallel" ones, meet at two separate points). For example, triangles in spherical geometry have more than 180 degrees and lines <i>don't</i> go on forever. All of this just goes on to show how important axioms are and how even counter-intuitive ones can start a whole new branch of mathematics.</p>
