    <h1>Calculator Fun</h1>
        <h3>Art</h3>
            <p>Note that most of the things I am about to recommend require a more expensive graphing calculator like the TI-84. (All of these things work on a TI-84 Plus C Silver Edition calculator, so I would recommend trying these things on that calculator if you have one.)</p>
            <p>So, if you didn't know, you can draw on your calculator. (Go to 2nd, prgm, then you get a lot of options such as drawing horizontal or vertical lines. The pen tool [at the very bottom of the list] allows you to draw pixel by pixel. [For this one, you can press enter to start/stop drawing.]) To change the color of your pen, press graph then use the arrow keys to select the new color and press enter. To save your drawing, press 2nd prgm, then move right to the "sto" list of options, then press enter and then pick a number (0-9). To pull up an old drawing, press 2nd prgm, go to the "sto" list of options again, press 2, then choose the which drawing you want to pull up by entering the number you chose for it when you saved it earlier. </p>

        <h3>Programming</h3>
            <p>As the title suggests, you can write, download, and run programs on your calculator. These can range anywhere from programs that solve a quadratic equation for you to games like pong or even mario. It is easy enough to look up programs for specific tasks, but if you want to learn how to write your own programs for your calculator, I would highly recommend the <a href ="http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/welcome-pack">wikidot</a> website. It includes the source code for some basic games, explanations of all of the commands a calculator program can use, and more.</p>
        <h3>Miscellaneous</h3>
            <p>0.1134. Or, in English, hello. If you type in 0.1134 in an old calculator and then look at it upside down, it kind of looks like it says "hello".</p>
