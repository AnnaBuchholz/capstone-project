    <h3>Disputes between Two Mathematicians</h3>
        <h5>Tartaglia (Niccolo Fontana) v. Antonio Fior</h5>
            <p>This dispute was over who could solve certain cubic equations. Before this, nobody had ever publicly shown how to solve cubic equations using algebra, so both people doubted the other's claim that they could solve the cubic euqations algebraically. This may surprise you, but the first person to actually do this was neither Trataglia nor Fior but a guy by the name of Scipione del Ferro. However, del Ferro only knew how to solve cubic equations of the form x^3 + ax = b. Del Ferro eventually passed on this information to Fior while del Ferro was on his deathbed. Tartaglia on the other hand, had figured out how to solve equations with the form x^3 + ax^2 = b after his friend Zuanne da Coi had challenged him with two problems. The contest was scheduled for February 13, 1535 (still one year before the addition symbol was even invented!), and each contestant was to submit 30 problems for the other to solve. Of course, Fior just sent Tartaglia 30 of the x^3 +ax = b problems since this was the only type Fior knew how to solve. On the other hand, Tartaglia sent Fior multiple different types of equations (Tartaglia had gotten inspiration on how to solve the x^3 + ax = b equations in the wee hours of February 13, 1535). In the end, Tartaglia was able to solve all 30 of Fior's problems in less than two hours while Fior had barely gotten anywhere with Tartaglia's problems, so it was clear to all that Tartaglia won.

            <p>Now <i>this</i> dispute was COLOSSAL. You probably have never heard of Leibniz, but during his life he was much more well known than even Newton. After all, Leibniz was a polymath who made significant contributions to math (aside from calculus, he also invented the binary system which is fundamental for whatever you are reading this on to even run; also, he proposed the basis for general topology, another field in mathematics), law, geology (he theorized that the Earth was at first molten), medicine, and philosophy. Additionally, he worked on windmills, lamps, hydraulic presses, submarines, clocks, and more. He also attempted to bring the Protestants and Catholics back together and he even genealogically proved that the House of Hanover had its origins in the House of Este, thus giving the House of Hanover/Brunswick (which Ernst August, his employer, was in) much more political power. (This allowed Ernst August to become the ninth Electorate in the Holy Roman Empire, and his son-in-law Friedrich III eventually became Friedrich I, the first king of Prussia.) I bring all of this up to show how Leibniz really did have similarly important contributions to many fields as Newton did. Anyways, during The Calculus Wars (I got that name from a book of the same title by Jason Socrates Bardi which I would recommend if you want a <i>much</i> more in depth look into this dispute), Leibniz was probably <i>more</i> respected than even Newton. Newton first invented calculus in 1665 (he was 24), but he didn't publish his findings until 1693. Newton waited to publish for two main reasons. Firstly, when he had published his first version of <i>Principia</i> (formerly known as <i>Philosophiae naturalis Principia Mathematica</i>) in 1686, Robert Hooke (both he and Newton were members of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge) had viciously attacked him since it had contradicted Hooke's previous work and theories. Newton had planned on publishing his work on calculus soon after, but most assuredly did not want that sort of thing to happen again. The second reason that Newton waited to publish his findings on calculus was that the Great Fire of London happened on September 2, 1666. This means that printing materials became much more scarce, and thus made publishing new books much more expensive. Now, between the time when Newton first discovered calculus and when he published his findings, Leibniz both discovered it himself <i>and</i> published his findings. Leibniz said that he first conceived of the idea of calculus around 1674, then he published his work in 1684, well before Newton published his version. Basically, since Newton could prove that he had figured it out well before Leibniz, he assumed that Leibniz had plagiarized his work.</p>
                <blockquote>Leibniz and Newton fought it out until Leibniz died.</blockquote>
            <p>What really happened was that since Newton had waited so long to publish his work on calculus, Leibniz had thought that nobody had yet discovered calculus, and he had ample time to figure it out and publish it well before Newton did. (Leibniz and Newton had sent a few letters back and forth, and Newton had only hinted at a few of the things he knew how to do since he did not want to give away the secrets to calculus. Thus, Leibniz assumed that Newton didn't have much work done on calculus while Newton assumed he had given away too much which allowed Leibniz to plagiarize his work.) Leibniz and Newton fought it out until Leibniz died, then after that Newton kept on attacking Leibniz's work. This led to Leibniz's reputation and fame to be greatly diminished, even to this day. (And conversely, after Newton died, he had a meteoric rise to fame well above where he had been during his lifetime.) Nowadays, people tend to recognize Leibniz and Newton as two people who independently created calculus. To this day, some people argue about who did more for mathematics since Newton had technically created it first but Leibniz had been the one to share it with the world (and his notation is thought to be much better than Newton's, so Leibniz's notation is used to this day).</p>
    <h3>Miscellaneous Disputes</h3>
        <h5>Math v Maths</h5>
            <p>If you didn't know, Brits tend to say "maths" as a shorthand for mathematics, while Americans tend to say "math." Of course, Brits argue that "maths" is right since mathematics ends in "s" and thus must be a plural noun (meaning its shorthand should be plural also). However, they're wrong (and no, I can't possibly be biased at all since I'm an American). Since mathematics is actually considered an "uncountable" (or "mass") noun, it <i>can't</i> be pluralized. The word "mathematics" is a weird "uncountable" noun in that it can either be used abstractly (as in a broad type of inquiry; "the abstract science of number, quantity, and space"), <i>or</i> as a grouping of multiple different areas of mathematics (such as geometry, algebra, and topology, all of which act as "countable" nouns). In neither case, does the word "mathematics" act as a plural. (In the first case, you simply cannot pluralize an abstract "uncountable" noun, and in the second case, you would only pluralize a <i>modifier</i> of the noun [such as "areas of mathematics"].) Additionally, the word itself began as "mathematic" (no "s") in the 14th century (and before that, it was a Greek noun meaning "lesson" or "that which is learnt" and was spelled "mathema"). In the 17th century, the word "mathematic" became "mathematics" which, as you can see, has a new "s" on the end. Subjects with an "s" on the end were pretty common in the 17th century, and some other examples include: ecnomics, physics, acoustics, acrostics (which, according to Google, means "a poem, word puzzle, or other cmposition in which certain letters in each line form a word or words."), politics, ethics, athletics, linguistics, and others. Of course, not all words acquired an "s" at the end, and to this day, words like "arithmetic" are used without an "s" at the end. If all of that etymology didn't convince you that you should use "math" as the correct abbreviation of mathematics, then hopefully this next bit will change your mind. "Math" as an abbreviation for mathematics first appeared in print well before "maths" did. "Maths" was first used in 1911, but Isaac Newton himself once used the phrase "Math: books" in one of his writings (the colon symbolized that the word was an abbreviation, similarly to how we use periods nowadays for certain abbreviations such as "in." for inch). (Granted, "math" was only commonly accepted in the 20th century [and 1924 was the first year in which it was used in print without a period or a colon; 1959 was the first time in which the term "maths" was used without a period or a colon].) Anyways, "math." (with the period, signifying that it was still a more informal abbreviation) first appeared in print in 1847, but had droppped the period by he 1870's, well before "maths" first appeared in print in 1911. Additionally, when one uses the term "mathematics" in a sentence, it is used in the singular. (For example, one might exclaim, "Mathematics <i>is</i> my favorite subject!") In short, I'd argue "math" is the correct abbreviation of mathematics since it is used in the singular (yes, even though mathematics has an "s" on the end), "math" was adopted well before "maths" was, and other similar words like economics have abbreviations like "econ" (without an "s" at the end).</p>
        <h5>Pi v. e</h5>
                <blockquote>e^(pi*i) + 1 = 0</blockquote>
            <p>Pi, one of the most loved numbers in mathematics. And e, that often looked-over middle child. Lots of mathematicians love both but have a clear preference for one of them, but personally I don't have an unshakable opinion on this issue. Yes, one learns about pi much earlier in their schooling, but e is still a cool landmark along the path one trudges along when learning trigonometry and calculus. Now, what <i>I</i> think is cooler than just e or just pi is when they team up in Euler's formula. e^(pi*i) + 1 = 0. (Yes, Euler managed to get e, pi, 0, 1, and even i to team up in this neat little equation which seems like it should have been impossibly difficult. But, of course, Euler found a way.)</p>
        <h5>Fibonacci Numbers v. Lucas Numbers</h5>
            <p>So, you've heard of the Fibonacci Numbers. But have you heard of the Lucas Numbers? No. Of course not. The Fibonacci Numbers overshadow them much like pi overshadows e. Personally, I don't have a strong preference for either, but some people (like Matt Parker) do. I like thinking about them as complementary. The Fibonacci numbers are named after Leonardo Pisano (often called Fibonacci [surprising, I know]) and are found using very simple rules. The first two numbers are 0 and 1, respectively. All the numbers after that are found by adding up the two numbers directly before the number in the sequence you want to calculate. (This means the first few numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21... As an example, 8, the 7th number in the sequence is found by adding 3 and 5 [the 5th and 6th numbers in the sequence, respectively]. Next, 13 is found by adding 5 and 8, and the patern continues.) The Lucas Series works the same way, except that the starting numbers are 2 and 1, respectively (and so the sequence goes 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11... which is obviously different than the Fibonacci Sequence). Because the Fibonacci Sequence is so similar to the Lucas Sequence, I would honestly consider them equally "cool" (though, to be fair, the Fibonacci Sequence was found first, which some would argue makes it cooler than the Lucas Sequence).</p>
        <h5>Math: Invented or Discovered?</h5>
            <p>Alright, for this one, I do have an opinion. Mathematical <i>axioms</i> are invented, but everything that follows is simply discovered. (Yes, yes, this is kind of a cop-out. But, if you were to force me to choose, I'd probably say invented since the underlying foundation of <i>all</i> of mathematics [the axioms] are invented. Since the axioms are so foundational, nothing could be discovered mathematically without them. [Or, as another way of putting it, there could be no game without rules.]) But, one might say, if math is more <i>ivented</i> than <i>discovered</i>, then why is it able to explain so many things in the real world? Well, well, well. I don't have a great reason for this except that mathematics is unreasonably useful. Again, if that is too much of a cop-out for you, let me do my best to explain. In some cases, like when Newton and Leibniz created calculus, the math was invented for a specific purpose (for calculus, it was to describe motion). Of course, the second type of case is the perplexing one. This is when a mathematician makes math simply for the fun of it with no purpose in mind and then years, decades, or even centuries later, it is found to be the absolutely necessary foundation to a whole different field. Thin this doesn't happen? Think again. So-called "pure" mathematics is simply done for the sake of doing it. And yet, in many circumstances it is found crucial to a new field. For example, "number theory" was considered pure math... until someone figured out it can be used for encryption. So yeah, you can thank Pierre de Fermat who created number theory for letting you buy things online. Oh, and he created it in the <b>seventeenth</b> century. The 17th century! And now, it's found to be useful in something so complex we can be sure Fermat didn't expect it to be used in this way. Of course, there are numerous other examples that I won't explain here. Anyways, even though math is invented, it is, inexplicably, useful in so many ways. (If you're interested in whether math is invented or discovered, you can read this short <a href="https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/great-math-mystery/">article</a>).</p>
