    <h1>Legendary Math Wars</h1>

    <h3>About</h3>
        <p>This page lists some of the famous mathematical disputes throughout the centuries. The ones listed here are mainly ones where multiple mathemaicans claimed that they solved something before their rival.</p>

    <h3>Tartaglia (Niccolo Fontana) v. Antonio Fior</h3>
        <p>This dispute was over who could solve certain cubic equations. Before this, nobody had ever publicly shown how to solve cubic equations using algebra, so both people doubted the other's claim that they could solve the cubic euqations algebraically. This may surprise you, but the first person to actually do this was neither Trataglia nor Fior but a guy by the name of Scipione del Ferro. However, del Ferro only knew how to solve cubic equations of the form x^3 + ax = b. Del Ferro eventually passed on this information to Fior while del Ferro was on his deathbed. Tartaglia on the other hand, had figured out how to solve equations with the form x^3 + ax^2 = b after his friend Zuanne da Coi had challenged him with two problems. The contest was scheduled for February 13, 1535 (still one year before the addition symbol was even invented!), and each contestant was to submit 30 problems for the other to solve. Of course, Fior just sent Tartaglia 30 of the x^3 +ax = b problems since this was the only type Fior knew how to solve. On the other hand, Tartaglia sent Fior multiple different types of equations (Tartaglia had gotten inspiration on how to solve the x^3 + ax = b equations in the wee hours of February 13, 1535). In the end, Tartaglia was able to solve all 30 of Fior's problems in less than two hours while Fior had barely gotten anywhere with Tartaglia's problems, so it was clear to all that Tartaglia won.

    <h3>Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz v. Isaac Newton</h3>
        <p>Now <i>this</i> dispute was COLOSSAL. You probably have never heard of Leibniz, but at one point he was much more well known than even Newton. After all, Leibniz was a polymath who made significant contributions to math (aside from calculus, he also invented the binary system which is fundamental for whatever you are reading this on to even run; also, he proposed the basis for general topology, another field in mathematics), law, geology (he theorized that the Earth was at first molten), medicine, and philosophy. Additionally, he worked on windmills, lamps, hydraulic presses, submarines, clocks, and more. He also attempted to bring the Protestants and Catholics back together and he even genealogically proved that the House of Hanover had its origins in the House of Este, thus giving the House of Hanover (which F.. .. .. ..) much more political power.. .. .. ..</p>
