    <h3>Youtubers</h3>
        <p>Brady Haran - This is the person who runs the Numberphile channel. He goes around to mathematicians around the world, asks them about something, then edits the videos and adds some graphics to make even a complex subject much easier to understand. Of his videos, I would recommend the video about the Parker Square - this one is comedy gold (you'll have to wait a few minutes, but it's there). Additionally, sometimes he will upload videos with songs about math (I would also recommend the song about googol) or just miscellaneous math fun.</p>
        <p>Matt Parker - Matt has done many, many different things to share his knowledge about diverse aspects of math. Sometimes he is featured on the Youtube channel Numberphile where he takes about 15 minutes to go over any number of topics. He also hosts his own channel called standupmaths where he does similar things but with a slightly different format. For example, sometimes he will write programs to help him compute gigantic numbers that follow a very specific set of rules or to be able to find solutions to complex problems. In addition, he has written great books such as <i>Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension: A Mathematician's Journey Through Narcissistic Numbers, Optimal Dating Algorithms, at Least Two Kinds of Infinity, and More</i> and <i>Humble Pi: A Comedy of Maths Errors</i>. He has also done numerous skits that focus on math. (For example, on the Numberphile channel he was explained many different math jokes, and in another skit, he helped someone sing about a googol).

    <h3>Apps</h3>

    <p>Here is a list of some apps, models, and games I have found that can be downloaded on Apple devices:</p>
        <p>Geogebra - This is a series of apps that has graphing calculators and the like. Sometimes it is used for Numberphile (a Youtube channel about math) videos to show models. </p>
        <p>Desmos - This is another graphing calculator, and I personally like it more than Geogebra because I find it to be a more intuitive graphing calculator. As far as I know, it can do just as much as Geogebra's graphing calculator can, plus you can share graphs with other people and can sign up and easily save them for later use. Desmos can graph many equations, from the simple x/y ones to r/theta ones and it can even use t.</p>
        <p><b>Torus Games and Hyperbolic Games</b> <br>Torus Games - This is a great app where you can play games like tic-tac-toe on a torus (dougnut shape) rather than a flat surface. This works very similarly to pac-man where something that goes off one side of the screen reappears on the other (left/right and top/bottom). I think this app is great because it is unique, yet intuitive enough to be fun for a while. It has over 10 games with multiple difficulty levels for each (and some of them have a toggle between a computer and human opponent). </p>
        <p>Hyperbolic Games - This is another great app from the same developer. It has a similar concept except all of the games are on a hyperbolic surface which is much harder to understand than toruses, so it is recommended you check out Torus Games first. This game also only has three different games to try, but I would still recommend trying it out since you can change some things like the surface (to a sphere or hexagonal torus) from the settings page and it gives you a better understanding of these surfaces.</p>
        <p><b><i>Remember to add to this one</i></b>Generative Tree Fractal Explorer - This is an app that shows you how different "fractal trees" look like and can help you better grasp the nature of fractal trees after you play around a bit with this app. It lets you choose up to five different nodes and lets you choose which nodes will generate other nodes.</p>
