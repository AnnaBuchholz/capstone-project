<h3>People who Teach Math Concepts</h3>
<p>Matt Parker - Matt has done many, many different things to share his knowledge about diverse aspects of math. Sometimes he is featured on the Youtube channel Numberphile where he takes about 15 minutes to go over any number of topics. He also hosts his own channel called standupmaths where he does similar things but with a slightly different format. For example, sometimes he will write programs to help him compute gigantic numbers that follow a very specific set of rules or to be able to find solutions to complex problems. In addition, he has written great books such as <i>Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension: A Mathematician's Journey Through Narcissistic Numbers, Optimal Dating Algorithms, at Least Two Kinds of Infinity, and More</i> and <i>Humble Pi: A Comedy of Maths Errors</i>. He has also done numerous skits that focus on math. (For example, on the Numberphile channel he was explained many different math jokes, and in another skit, he helped someone sing about a googol).

<h3>Apps</h3>

<p>Here is a list of some apps, models, and games I have found that can be downloaded on Apple devices:</p>
    <p>Geogebra - This is a series of apps that has graphing calculators and the like. Sometimes it is used for Numberphile (a Youtube channel about math) videos to show models. </p>
    <p><b>Torus Games and Hyperbolic Games</b> <br>Torus Games - This is a great app where you can play games like tic-tac-toe on a torus (dougnut shape) rather than a flat surface. This works very similarly to pac-man where something that goes off one side of the screen reappears on the other (left/right and top/bottom). I think this app is great because it is unique, yet intuitive enough to be fun for a while. It has over 10 games with multiple difficulty levels for each (and some of them have a toggle between a computer and human opponent). </p>
    <p>Hyperbolic Ganes - This is another great app from the same developer. It has a similar concept except all of the games are on a hyperbolic surface which is much harder to understand than toruses, so it is recommended you check out Torus Games first. This game also only has three different games to try, but I would still recommend trying it out since you can change some things like the surface (to a sphere or hexagonal torus) from the settings page and it gives you a better understanding of these surfaces.</p>
